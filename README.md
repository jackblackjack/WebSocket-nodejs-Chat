WebSocket nodejs Chat
=====================
This is a single page application with a nodejs backend. The data is provided by WebSocket. There will be a online demo
soon.


Build
-----
There is a Gruntfile.js for building the webapp with grunt so you need [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Just run on CLI:

	npm install
	grunt
	grunt server
	// or run native:
	node build/app.js


Browser support
---------------
This application uses WebSockets. This works for nearly every current Browser:
[caniuse.com/websockets](http://caniuse.com/websockets)


Thanks to
---------
- Twitter for Bootstrap
- Designmodo for the Chatlogo which I used as icon
